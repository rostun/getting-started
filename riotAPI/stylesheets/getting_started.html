			<h3>1 Guide Assumptions</h3>
			
			<p>This guide is designed for mostly for beginners who are looking for a way to get started 
			using Riot's API, but it can also be useful for someone curious about how to use Javascript 
			to implement the process. It does not assume that you have any prior experience working with API's, 
			but it will help. There are a few things that you need to follow along with the examples in this guide:</p>
			
				<ul>
					<li>A <a href="http://www.leagueoflegends.com">League of Legends</a> account.</li>
					<li>Something that handles HTTP requests and responses. </li>
				</ul>
			
			<p>If you are totally new to programming don't worry, you don't need any prior experience to follow along with
			the guide. You don't even need to download anything to test your API, although having some kind of text editor like 
			<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">notepad++</a> might help make things more readable. But you don't even need 
			that either, you can just make a txt document and change the extension to whatever you need. However, having some knowledge 
			of programming concepts will help in your understanding of the examples. </p>
			
			<p> On the other hand, if you are using this as a starting point for Javascript or even HTML, here are some introduction 
			resources to get you started:</p>
			
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/">w3schools Javascript</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent Javascript</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">w3schools HTML</a></li>
				</ul>
			
			<p>This guide only goes over code examples that you can easily test out as long as you have something that handles HTTP request 
			and responses. What it means to the average person is just basically opening up your html file in browser and, theoretically, 
			everything should work. If or how you want to host it is totally up to you! Let's get started! </p>

			<h3>2 What is an API? </h3>
			<p>In layman's terms, you can think of an API as an agreement between two people stating </p>
				<div class="info">
					<p><strong>"If you give me this instruction, I will perform this action, or return this information"</strong></p>
				</div>
			<p>Most people are used to interacting and navigating on a website through some sort of graphical interface to get information, 
			for example, to check the weather. However, machines don't need any of that to check the weather, and neither do you, if you know 
			how to comprehend this alternative "user interface" that software use to interact with other software. This shorthand way 
			to do things like checking the current weather or adding an event to your calendar is what an API provides.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "wrapper">
			<h3>3 Lets get Started: The API Key </h3>
			
			<p>You can think of the <strong>API key</strong> as a password for you to gain access to information. Every Riot Games API request 
			requires an API key, so you will need to include your API key using the api_key for each request you want to make/use.</p>
			
			<p>If you play or have played League of Legends before, you probably already have a League of Legends account. 
			So to get the API key, all you need to do is navigate to the <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/sign-in">Riot Games Developers</a> 
			website and sign in with your summoner name and password. After you've signed up, you will be able to see your API
			key on the dashboard. <strong> Copy and paste it in a file somewhere. </strong> You can always go back to your dashboard to retrieve it again
			but it's good to get into the habit of making sure you have a copy of your keys floating around somewhere (somewhere safe). 
			
			<p>You'll see that there is a short <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/getting-started">getting started</a> orientation page 
			that you can read. </p>
			
			<img src="../stylesheets/gettingStarted.png" alt="getting started" style="width:100%;height:100%;">
			
			<p>There are several different versions of keys, the one you get by default has the smallest rate limit. Unless you're trying to 
			make a site like op.gg or have big dreams, you'll be quite okay with the key you have now. They also mention that you should be familiar with 
			JSON objects and Object Oriented programming before getting started. Don't worry brah, this guide has got yah covered on dat! </p>
		</div>
		<div class = "wrapper">
			<h3>4 Test your API key</h3>
			<p>Before we get started, we want to make sure that your API key actually works. Nothing is more lame than spending an inordinate amount of time
			trying to figure out what is wrong with your program and then realizing that you copied your API key wrong or something. So open up your browser 
			and test the Summoner Look Up request! </p>
			
			<p>To test the request, just enter in the request like how you would enter a web page in, as seen below. (Remember to replace <code>&ltkey&gt</code> with 
			<strong>your API Key</strong>). If you want to see your details, replace <code>riotSchmick</code> with your summoner name</p>
			
			<img src="../stylesheets/testAPI.png" alt="getting started" style="width:100%;height:100%;">
			
			<p>If your key works, you should see something like this: </p>
			
			<img src="../stylesheets/testAPISuccess.png" alt="getting started" style="width:100%;height:100%;">
			
			<p>You can probably already tell how the information is organized for this request. You see your summoner name and details about your account in
			quotes, and that this information is organized in a certain way. You can only assume this form is in <strong>JSON</strong>, because that's what rito said!
			But if you're a beginner you might be asking what even is JSON? What's an Object? How do I extract this information that I got from this API to make 
			something that users can interact with? Well, no better way to learn than to get this process started! </p>
		</div>
		<div class = "wrapper">
			<h3>5 HTML: What information from the API to Display?</h3>
			<p>To follow along with this guide, you'll need set up some files to work with. Let's first start with the HTML file. 
			This is a good time to start thinking of what you want to show in your web page. For the sake of demonstration, we'll be showing every element
			that the Summoner Look Up Object has to give. </p>
			
			<p>So create a text file and rename it to riotApiTest with a .html extension instead of a .txt extension (riotApiTest.html) and fill it with this: </p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/rostun/87a3665570a8044a1b22.js"></script>
			
			<p>If you're a beginner, you must be thinking, what did I just do? Well, if you go to the folder where this file is and double-click on it, 
			it should pop up in your web browser as something that looks like this:</p>
			<img src="../stylesheets/followAlong.png" alt="follow along" style="width:75%;height:75%;">
			
			<p>An HTML file is basically the web page version of a text file and comes with it's own rules for implementation. 
			You might notice that your html file doesn't look like the web page you just opened, although you can see the contents distributed throughout
			the html file with the words enclosed with "<" and ">" characters not appearing in the browser page. Those are called <strong> HTML Tags </strong>. 
			HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how the browser must format and display the content. We won't go into too much detail, 
			but you can easily look up or even deduce what all the tags do and mean. For example the words enclosed by the <code>&lttitle&gt</code> and <code>&lt/title&gt</code>
			tags appear as the description in the web tab. </p>
			
			<p>One special tag that foreshadows what we'll be doing next is the <code>&input type="text"/&gt</code> tag. This actually enables a place for text input 
			(you can try typing in it). You may have already typed your summoner name and then halfway through realized that there's no way to submit it.
			Thus, let's add an input type called <code>button</code> and label it <code>Search Summoner</code>. Add the new input type into your html file as shown below: </p>
				<div class="info">
						</code>&ltp&gt&ltinput type="text"/&gt&lt/p&gt</code><br>
						</code><strong>&ltinput type="button" value="Search Summoner"/&gt</code></strong><br>
						<br>
						</code>&lth3&gtBasic Summoner Object&lt/h3&gt</code>
				</div>		
				
			<p>After you've saved and refreshed the HTML page you can see that you've got a button! Sweet! </p>
			<img src="../stylesheets/button.png" alt="follow along" style="width:50%;height:50%;">
			
			<p>But again, it probably didn't take you long to figure out that 
			that's all it is, a button. Clicking on it does absolutely nothing. Remember that an HTML file is basically the web page version of a text file. So while we have
			want we want visually there's no functionality. Well Javascript can help us with that. Onward bb! </p> 
		</div>
		<div class = "wrapper">
			<h3>6 Getting Information you want from the API: Javascript </h3>
			<p>So create a text file and rename it to riotApiTest with, but this time with a .js extension instead of an .html extension (riotApiTest.js) and fill it with this: </p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/rostun/1587b64f48088eeba5c2.js"></script>
			
			<p>So let's look at what we have here. Essentially, this entire thing is a function called <code>searchSummoner</code>. Functions are basically like actions, 
			they do things. The names we give functions usually represent what we want them to do. Remember our button? When we click it, we want something to happen. 
			We want Riot to look up a summoner name and give us some information. So <code>searchSummoner()</code> seems like an appropriate name. </p>
			
			<p>However, you can't ask riot to search for a summoner name without giving them that name. That means another action, or function, is needed. So while we ask
			Riot to search a summoner for us, we have to somehow get them the summoner's name the user inputs. So calling the funciton <code>getSummoner()</code> seems like a pretty 
			good name for that action. We don't actually know what that name is YET, but we can do this thing where we allocate a slot for it, which will allow us to fill it in later. 
			This is called declaring a variable. In this case our variable is called <code>aPromisedName</code>. Let's look at what is inside this mini <code>getSummoner()</code> action. </p>
			<div class="info">
					<p>
						<strong><code>return</code></strong> <br>
						<strong><code>document.getElementById('aPromisedName').value</code></strong>
					</p>
			</div>		
			
			<p><strong><code>document.getElementById('aPromisedName').value</code>:</strong> This is basically going into the HTML document we created earlier, taking 
			whatever summoner name the user gives us, and putting it into the slot <code>aPromisedName</code> we made earlier.</p>
			
			<p><strong><code>return</code>:</strong> So every function can return something. A function is like a factory. If you start <code>getSummoner()</code>, it will 
			execute whatever directions it is given and then at the end, hopefully, have something it produces. In this case, as you can see in line 5, we execute
			<code>getSummoner()</code> once, and store whatever it produces into a slot called <strong><code>summonerName</code></strong>. 
			
			<p>So, in this case, we're hoping the <code>getSummoner()</code> factory gives us a summoner name! There is a way to see what is in our slots. We can use the 
			<code>console.log()</code> command to output to the console whatever is contained in the parenthesis. In our case, we want to see what's in <code>summonerName</code> to 
			make sure we've got what we want. </p>
			
			<p>To access the console from your browser, right click on your page and click on inspect. This will bring up a window where you can see what your web page is made out of.
			You'll probably be in the Elements tab, where you can see your HTML source code, if you switch to the <strong>Console</strong> tab you will see the console!</p>
			
			<p>Unfortunately, unlike HTML, we can't just open up a .js file in browser and see what's up. So to test our .js file we need to do it through our HTML file. Let's add
			these functionalities to our two inputs from before, the text block and the button!</p>
