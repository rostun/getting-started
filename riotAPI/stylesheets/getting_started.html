			<h2>Getting Started with Riot's API</h2>
				<p>This guide covers getting up and running with Ruby on Rails.</p>
				<p>After reading this guide, you will know:</p>
				<ul id = "navlist">
					<li>How to install Rails, create a new Rails application, and connect your application to a database.</li>
					<li>The general layout of a Rails application.</li>
					<li>The basic principles of MVC (Model, View, Controller) and RESTful design.</li>

			<h3>1 Guide Assumptions</h3>
				<p>This guide is designed for beginners who want to get started with a Rails
				application from scratch. It does not assume that you have any prior experience
				with Rails. However, to get the most out of it, you need to have some
				prerequisites installed:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads">Ruby</a> language version 1.9.3 or newer.</li>
					<li>The <a href="https://rubygems.org">RubyGems</a> packaging system, which is installed with Ruby
					versions 1.9 and later. To learn more about RubyGems, please read the <a href="http://guides.rubygems.org">RubyGems Guides</a>.</li>
					<li>A working installation of the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org">SQLite3 Database</a>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Rails is a web application framework running on the Ruby programming language.
				If you have no prior experience with Ruby, you will find a very steep learning
				curve diving straight into Rails. There are several curated lists of online resources
				for learning Ruby:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/">Official Ruby Programming Language website</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://resrc.io/list/10/list-of-free-programming-books/#ruby">reSRC's List of Free Programming Books</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Be aware that some resources, while still excellent, cover versions of Ruby as old as
				1.6, and commonly 1.8, and will not include some syntax that you will see in day-to-day
				development with Rails.</p>

			<h3 id="what-is-rails-questionmark">2 What is Rails?</h3>
			<p>Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language.
			It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions
			about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less
			code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks.
			Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application
			development more fun.</p>
			<p>Rails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is the "best"
			way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to
			discourage alternatives. If you learn "The Rails Way" you'll probably discover a
			tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from
			other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you
			learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.</p>
			<p>The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Don't Repeat Yourself:</strong> DRY is a principle of software development which
				states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative
				representation within a system." By not writing the same information over and over
				again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.</li>
				<li><strong>Convention Over Configuration:</strong> Rails has opinions about the best way to do many
				things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than
				require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="creating-a-new-rails-project">3 Creating a New Rails Project</h3>
			<p>The best way to use this guide is to follow each step as it happens, no code or
			step needed to make this example application has been left out, so you can
			literally follow along step by step.</p>
			<p>By following along with this guide, you'll create a Rails project called
			<code>blog</code>, a (very) simple weblog. Before you can start building the application,
			<div class="info">
				<p>The examples below use <code>$</code> to represent your terminal prompt in a UNIX-like OS,
				though it may have been customized to appear differently. If you are using Windows,
				your prompt will look something like <code>c:\source_code&gt;</code></p>
